# OLS-Parser

OLS file format are files generated by some logic sniffer softwares like "OLS java logic sniffer" or "SUMP"

Ols-parser is a python script that can parse several OLS files, detects frames, decodes frames according to parameters, sorts them and then, export all the data in an XLSX file.

This script was writen in the purpose to help me to decode unknown protocols.
